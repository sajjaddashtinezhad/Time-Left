                            The Life Timer app calculates your estimated remaining days and hours based on your gender and country's average life expectancy. It serves as a powerful reminder to be conscious of each moment and the preciousness of your life.

                            I first encountered this powerful idea in an interview with Jesse Itzler: he would write the remaining days of his life on his palm. This wasn't a dark approach; in fact, it's quite the opposite. It served as a potent reminder not to squander precious time on things he dislikedâ€”whether it was mindlessly doom-scrolling, excessive drinking, or other unfulfilling activities. Instead, it was an invitation to be present, to live each moment mindfully, and to pursue what truly resonated with him.
